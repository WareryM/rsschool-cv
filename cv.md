## Summary

Сurrently working as a design engineer. In the process of work, I studied the work of many microcircuits, the requirements of regulatory documents, the rules for the development of microcircuits, as well as document flow. I like to learn new things, so in my free time I studied foreign languages and programming languages. Now my goal is to study Frontend Development, because it is the most promising area of web development with a large community and a lot of training material.
